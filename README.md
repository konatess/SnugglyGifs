# SnugglyGifs
Homework for UW Coding Bootcamp: using APIs.
This homework takes the search term from the button, adds snuggle as a second search term, and returns 10 gifs from the Giphy API with those search terms. Unfortunately, because of the way Giphy's search works, and because many of the gifs lack key tags, the project didn't turn out quite as I had envisioned. For many search terms, there are several gifs that appear not to be relevant to the search.
